## Devlogs

Hello World!

### W1

Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2
The r, g, and b variables are floats and not integers, strings or booleans, because an integer is a whole number
and the r, g, b values are not whole numbers. Strings are text and booleans are either true or false, none of these
data types applies to what the r, g, b values are. Similarily, the bounce variable is an integer because it is a whole
number and not the other types of data. To be honest, I didn't really see what the error specifically noted but I just 
compared the existing statement to my understanding based on the lecture. This lead to me adding a semicolon at the end
of the line.

Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

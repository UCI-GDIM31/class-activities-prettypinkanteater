## Devlogs

Hello World! lalalalalalalal!!! i am sick :( that is not lala

### W1

Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2
The r, g, and b variables are floats and not integers, strings or booleans, because an integer is a whole number
and the r, g, b values are not whole numbers. Strings are text and booleans are either true or false, none of these
data types applies to what the r, g, b values are. Similarily, the bounce variable is an integer because it is a whole
number and not the other types of data. To be honest, I didn't really see what the error specifically noted but I just 
compared the existing statement to my understanding based on the lecture. This lead to me adding a semicolon at the end
of the line.

Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

### W3

The input parameters would be the player sanity level as a float data type. There is no output/void return because there
is no operated on and returned value.

A class is a kitchen and the member variables inside of it are ingredients or tools present inside of the kitchen, the member methods 
are the cooking techniques that are able to be used inside the kitchen based on the ingredients and tools. You can also borrow and
use tools from another kitchen, or class. The resulting dish, or component functionality, is made from this kitchen. 

I think that the balls get extremely bright in the Scene if they bounce too many times because the brightness is based
off the amount of times bounced so as the amount of bounces increases, so does the brightness.

### W4
 Declaring a private boolean member variable called _isGrounded that has the value of true.

 If statement checking for 2 conditions, the member method (because it has parantheses) that 
 has the argument of the space key, that checks if the space key is down, of the Input class 
 and checking the value of the member variable _isGrounded value.

 Sets the boolean variable to false.
